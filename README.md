# Distributed Hashing Simulation using Chord Protocol

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and simulating Distributed Hash Table (DHT) algorithms, with a specific emphasis on the Chord protocol. The goal is to create a simple model for distributed hashing, simulate various scenarios, and analyze the results. This contributes to a deeper understanding of DHTs and their application in distributed systems, like NoSQL databases.

## Background
Distributed Hash Tables are pivotal in several distributed systems due to their efficiency in data management and retrieval. They are key to the scalability and fault tolerance of systems like peer-to-peer networks, file-sharing systems, and large-scale data storage solutions.

### What is Chord?
Chord is a protocol and algorithm for a peer-to-peer distributed hash table. It provides a way to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular piece of data. Chord simplifies the process of data lookup in a distributed environment using consistent hashing and a ring topology.
